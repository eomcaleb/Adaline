# Adaline
## Adaptive Linear Neuron
Adaptive Linear Neuron was released a few years after Perceptron. This model by nature is more mutable in how it learns the data set.
Instead of adjusting its value when the the neuron is activated (Perceptron), it uses the direct output (y-value) to fine-tune the weights accordingly.

The code reflects this model by learning the simple data set in four quadrants with an AND gate.
This model, like Single Layer Perceptron, cannot distinguish XOR gate. This can be addressed by using MADALINE- multilayer adaptive linear neuron.
