# Adaline
## Adaptive Linear Neuron
Adaptive Linear Neuron was released a few years after Perceptron. This model by nature is more mutable in how it learns the data set.
Instead of adjusting its value when the the neuron is activated (Perceptron), it uses the direct output (y-value) to fine-tune the weights accordingly, a.k.a. Stochastic Gradient Descent utilizing Mean Square Error loss function.
